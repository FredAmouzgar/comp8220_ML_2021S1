# Watch a Time-Loop Movie!

Training a reinforcement learning agent is very similar to time-loop movies. In these movies, the protagonist gains mastery over many skills, learn how to deal with their environments, and finally break the loop by achieving a goal.

So, one fun activity would be to watch one of them (if you haven't already) or remember one of them and compare it to the MDP loop, which trains a reinforcement learning agent. Try to map the movie to the MDP loop.

List of Time-Loop Movies:
Groundhog day (1993)
Source Code (2011)
Edge of Tomorrow (2014)
Boss Level (2021)

# Play Taxi

OpenAI Gym's Taxi is one of the environments we will tackle this week with reinforcement learning algorithms. It is an incredibly simple environment to demonstrate how RL algorithms work. With the right resources, hyperparameters and the right algorithm, we can learn much more difficult tasks.

Instruction:

1. Install OpenAI Gym: CMD> pip install gym
2. Open a command line and run the attached file: CMD> python play_taxi.py
