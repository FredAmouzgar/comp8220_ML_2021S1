# Machine Learning Unit (COMP8220), 2021S1

This repository has all the lectures and the practicals for week six and 12 of the machine learning course presented in the first semester of 2021 at the Department of Computing, Macquarie University ([COMP8220](https://unitguides.mq.edu.au/unit_offerings/137445/unit_guide)). It covers an introduction to classical and approximate reinforcement learning (RL). 

In week six, the mathematical theories behind RL and tabular methods such as On-policy First-visit Monte-Carlo, SARSA, and Q-Learning are discussed. In week twelve, the main focus is combining RL with function approximators and neural networks. DQN is the algorithm that we consider for its practical session.

You can find the lectures on the [Complexity-in-Action Lab](https://complexity-in-action.github.io/) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFm74Qt7qIr_O0KkvdlW-Q).
